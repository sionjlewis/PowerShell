# PowerShell SharePoint Online: Migrate Lists And Libraries

Export and Import site columns, content types, lists and libraries, and list views.

When developing Webparts, PowerApps or Cloud Flows that use SharePoint Online it can be very useful to replicate the data sources in multiple tenants. This set of scripts is focused on the export and import the data sources and their underlying assets, including  site columns, content types, lists and libraries, and list views.

This project is intended to accompany the content of my [S J Lewis](https://www.sjlewis.com) website.
